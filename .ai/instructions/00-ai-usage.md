# AI Instructions — Setup & Meta-Rules

This `.ai/` folder is the **single source of truth** for all AI instructions in this project. It is intentionally tool-agnostic: the same files work with Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, or any other AI assistant.

---

## The Tool-Agnostic Rule

**All AI instructions live exclusively in `.ai/`.** Never create tool-specific instruction files.

- Do **not** create `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.windsurfrules`, or any equivalent file — even as a thin pointer.
- Any AI assistant reading this repo must read the `.ai/` folder directly. No wrapper files.
- If a tool requires its own file to function, configure it to point to `.ai/` via its settings UI or config — do not create a file in the repo.

This keeps the repo clean and ensures instructions are maintained in one place regardless of which AI tool is in use.

## Setting Up a New Project

1. Copy this `.ai/` folder to the repo root.
2. Find and replace every `Flightlog` / `flightlog` placeholder with real values.
4. Fill in `instructions/01-project-overview.md` — tech stack, repo layout, data sources, user roles.
5. Start filling in `context/architecture.md` as you add tables, measurements, and routes.
6. Update `context/features.md` as milestones ship.

---

## Planning Mode

**When asked to plan (e.g. `/plan`, "let's plan this"), produce a plan and stop. Never start implementing immediately after a plan is approved.**

- Write the plan file → wait for an explicit "go ahead" / "implement" instruction in a new message.
- Approval of a plan means "the plan looks good" — not "start coding now".
- Do not write, edit, or create any files (except the plan file) during or immediately after planning.
- Implementation begins only when the user sends a separate follow-up message explicitly asking to proceed.

### Planning Workflow

For any non-trivial feature, follow this sequence. Each step produces artifacts in `specs/<NNN>-<feature-name>/`.

```
Specify → Clarify → Plan → Checklist → Tasks → Analyze → Implement
```

See the matching prompt file in `.ai/prompts/` for each step.

---

## Always Read First

Before making any changes, read the relevant `.ai/` files:

- `instructions/01-project-overview.md` — what the project is, tech stack, layout
- `instructions/02-backend-conventions.md` — how to add routes, tables, migrations
- `instructions/03-frontend-conventions.md` — no-build-step JS, i18n, theming
- `instructions/04-constraints.md` — hard rules (what NOT to do)
- `instructions/05-user-profile.md` — who the user is, how to communicate, working rules
- `instructions/08-operability.md` — logging doctrine, health endpoints, config transparency
- `context/architecture.md` — SQLite schema, domain algorithms, API contracts, deployment
- `context/features.md` — shipped milestones and backlog

---

## General AI Behavior Rules

- Don't add features, refactor code, or make "improvements" beyond what was asked.
- Don't add comments, docstrings, or type annotations to code you didn't change.
- Don't add error handling for scenarios that can't happen.
- Don't create helpers or abstractions for one-time operations.
- Don't design for hypothetical future requirements.
- Read files before suggesting changes to them.
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.

## Keeping the Repo in Sync

`.ai/` is the single source of truth, but humans (and other tools) also read plain files scattered across the repo — `README.md`, `PLANNING.md`, docs, changelogs. The AI must keep these in sync.

### When to update human-readable files

Update the relevant files whenever the `.ai/` context changes:

| `.ai/` change | Human-readable file(s) to update |
|---|---|
| New feature shipped / milestone completed | `README.md`, `PLANNING.md`, `docs/` if present |
| New API route added to `context/architecture.md` | `README.md` API section (if one exists) |
| Backlog or roadmap changed in `context/features.md` | `PLANNING.md` or `README.md` roadmap section |
| New setup step or dependency | `README.md` getting-started section |
| New tech stack entry in `01-project-overview.md` | `README.md` tech stack section |

**Rule**: If the `.ai/` context is the source of truth, human-readable files are derived output. Never let them drift more than one session behind.

**Before ending a session** (or when asked to prepare for `/clear`), run `.ai/prompts/sync.md` to flush all pending updates at once. This ensures that the `.ai/` context and all human-readable files are in sync.

### Staying in Sync with the Blueprint

If you want to pull in the latest framework improvements, new prompts, or updated instructions from the central [AI Blueprint](https://github.com/Think4dvantage/ai-blueprint), run:

`/prompt .ai/prompts/update-blueprint.md`

This will sync the project's framework files with the central repository while keeping your project-specific data intact.

## Constitution Principles

These principles govern all planning decisions. Amendments require explicit discussion.

1. **Read before acting**: Always read `.ai/` before suggesting or making changes.
2. **Plan before building**: Non-trivial features get a spec + plan before implementation.
3. **Minimal scope**: Implement what was asked, not more.
4. **Tool-agnostic instructions**: All AI context lives in `.ai/`, not in tool-specific files. Never create `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, or any equivalent. Nothing AI-related goes outside `.ai/`.
5. **Keep docs in sync**: Human-readable files (README, PLANNING, docs) are derived from `.ai/`. Run `sync.md` before ending a session.
6. **No secrets committed**: Config files and `.env` are gitignored. Only `.example` files are committed.
7. **Prod is off-limits**: Never touch production directly. All changes go through the deployment pipeline.
